```{r P2Q1 Which Hypothesis Test shall be performed.}

#We know that the company was started in March 2016, but we have data for last 35 days, so itâ€™s a small sample.
#There are 2 hypothesis test commonly used, Z and t test and as a general thumb of rule we use Z test if we have a sample size bigger than 30 and know the Population standard deviation. 
#So, in this case we have a sample size of 35 but we don't know the population standard deviation; from the sample we can find out the sample standard deviation and then use the t -test. 
#It is also proved that t test is more accurate because it tries to minimize the error in population standard deviation by taking into consideration the sample size,  hence in future it would be a good idea to perform this test on a bigger sample size.

```
  
```{r State the hypothesis and perform the hypothesis test}
#Ho : E[Temperature] <= 3.9
#HA : E[Temperature] > 3.9
meanS  = mean(Temperature)

sdS = sd(Temperature)
sdS

#Lets run the t-test
t.test(Temperature, mu = 3.9 ,alternative =  'greater' )
#p-value = 0.004711 = 0.471 %  . At alpha 0f 0.01 this probability is lesser than 1 % hence we reject the null hypotheises and can conclude that a corrective action in the storage plant is required

#Let's calculat the tscore seperately and verify the results.
tscore = (meanS - 3.9)/(sdS/sqrt(length(Temperature)))
tscore

#We need to find the probability of finding a tscore greater than the above tscore
pt(tscore , df = 24 , lower.tail = FALSE)
#p-value is 0.005543651 = 0.5% which is  lesser than alpha.
